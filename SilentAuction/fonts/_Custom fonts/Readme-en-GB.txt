Custom fonts may be added in this folder.
Place each font in a subfolder with a CSS which declares the necessary font-face elements.
The system will read all CSS files in this directory hierarchy and add all the declared font-face elements
to the list of fonts which may be selected in the application.
The contents of these folders will not be affected by updates to the application, so fonts will remain
available after the application is patched.
